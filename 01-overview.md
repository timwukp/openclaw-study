## Why This Study Matters

OpenClaw represents a category of AI-powered personal assistants that have:
- Deep access to personal devices and data
- Ability to act autonomously on behalf of users
- Persistent memory about users
- Control over communication channels
- Potential to operate without real-time human oversight

This study aims to deeply analyze the architecture, identify potential risks,
and evaluate the ethical implications of such systems.
