## Nature of This Work

This is an **independent security and ethics research study**. It is not
software, not a product, and not a service. It contains analysis, opinions,
and recommendations based on publicly available source code.

## Not Legal, Security, or Professional Advice

This study is provided for **informational and educational purposes only**.
Nothing in this study constitutes legal advice, professional security
consulting, or a formal security audit. Readers should consult qualified
professionals before making security decisions based on this analysis.

## No Affiliation

This study is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with** the
OpenClaw project, its developers, or any of the companies mentioned herein
(including but not limited to Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Meta, or any LLM
provider). "OpenClaw" and related project names are trademarks or trade
names of their respective owners.

## Methodology Limitations

- **Static analysis only** — No OpenClaw code was executed or penetration-tested
- **Public repository only** — Based on publicly available source code on GitHub
- **Point-in-time analysis** — Reflects the codebase as of February 2026; issues
  identified may already be addressed in later versions
- **No developer consultation** — The OpenClaw development team was not consulted
- **Risk scores are subjective** — Based on researchers' judgment, not independently validated

## Fair Use / Fair Dealing Statement

This study constitutes **commentary, criticism, and research** on a publicly
available open-source software project (MIT-licensed, hosted on public GitHub).
Analysis of publicly available source code for security research and public
interest reporting is protected under:

- **Fair use** (17 U.S.C. Section 107) — for purposes of criticism, comment,
  and research
- **Fair dealing** (applicable in UK, Canada, Australia, and other jurisdictions)
  — for purposes of research, private study, criticism, and review
- **EU Copyright Directive** (Article 5) — for purposes of scientific research

No proprietary code was copied, distributed, or executed. All analysis is
based on observations of publicly available code structure, file names,
directory layouts, and source code readable through the GitHub API.

## No Warranty

THIS STUDY IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED. THE AUTHORS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES REGARDING THE
ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, OR RELIABILITY OF ANY INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER
LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS STUDY OR ITS USE.

## Responsible Disclosure

This study analyzes architectural patterns and design decisions, not
specific exploitable vulnerabilities with proof-of-concept code. No
zero-day vulnerabilities are disclosed. No exploit code is provided.
Attack scenarios described are theoretical analyses based on architectural
observations, not demonstrated exploits.

If the OpenClaw project team identifies any factual errors in this study,
corrections are welcome via GitHub issues or pull requests.

## AI Assistance Disclosure

This study was conducted with the assistance of Claude (Anthropic), an AI
language model, operating as a research tool under human direction. All
analysis decisions, scope definitions, and editorial judgments were made
by the human researcher. The AI assisted with code analysis, document
drafting, and structured reasoning.
